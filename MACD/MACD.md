# Algorithmic Trading Project ‚Äì MACD Strategy on IBM

This project implements and backtests a simple **MACD (12, 26, 9) crossover trading strategy** on **IBM stock data** using Python and the **Backtrader** framework.  

The goal is to demonstrate a full trading research pipeline:
1. Data acquisition  
2. Strategy implementation  
3. Backtesting with a broker simulator  
4. Performance evaluation (PnL, Sharpe ratio, Drawdown, Win rate, etc.)  
5. Visualization of trading signals, MACD, and portfolio equity

- **MACD Line** = 12-day EMA ‚Äì 26-day EMA  
- **Signal Line** = 9-day EMA of MACD Line

- Final Portfolio Value

- PnL (Profit & Loss)

- Sharpe Ratio

- Maximum Drawdown (absolute and %)
